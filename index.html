        <h1>Welcome to
            <em>Harpe Gaming</em>.</h1>
        <p>We have a simple philosophy. It has three main points:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>&#10038; Unplug</li>
            <li>&#10038; Interact</li>
            <li>&#10038; Reconnect</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            <strong>And that's it.</strong> We believe that the best games are the ones that bring people together through shared
            experiences.
            <br/>With all due respect to our video gamer friends, you can't always get that from a computer screen.
            <br/>Sometimes you need the intimate approach of sitting face-to-face around a common table with the soda and chips
            at your elbow.</p>

        <p>We are a local board and card game store located in the heart of
            <em>Morgantown</em> near the campus.
            <br/>We carry hundreds of games and puzzles, including educational games, family games, card games, historical simulations,
            role-playing games, and so much more.
            <br/>If you remember a great game from your youth, we probably have it in our antiques collection. If we don't, we
            know where we can get it.</p>

        <p>We're more than just a place to buy games. We celebrate gaming and the company of good friends.
            <br/>Our game room is free for all to us. Sit down, pick out a game from our demo library and start playing.
            <br/> We sponsor tournaments, challenges, and special social events. You'll always find a game to play.</p>

        <p>We're always on the lookout for the best new games. We publish periodic reviews of new titles.
            <br/>Just out our reviews of
            <a href="hg_towers.html">
                <em>Towers and Temples</em>
            </a> and
            <a href="hg_alliance.html">
                <em>Alliance</em>
            </a>; both new this month at Harpe Gaming.</p>
